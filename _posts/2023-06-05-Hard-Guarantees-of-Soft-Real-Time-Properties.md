We've invited Prof. Jian-Jia Chen, from Department of Informatics in TU Dortmund University, to give us a presentation of 'Hard Guarantees of Soft Real-Time Properties'. This meeting was hosted by Prof. Wuu Yang and Prof. Yi-Ping You from Department of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.  

Proving hard real-time guarantees based on a classical analysis may significantly underutilize the processor in the average case. Therefore, instead of considering a very rare worst-case scenario, a probabilistic scheduling analysis determines the probability of a deadline miss. Such an analysis assumes that task execution times are given by a set of modes representing the range of possible execution scenarios. Considering tasks with multiple modes and different levels of assurances, in this case expressed as different probabilities to miss deadlines, for different tasks provides a natural link to mixed-criticality systems. This talk summarizes recent results in probabilistic real-time scheduling and some potential research directions. At the end of the talk, I will shortly discuss the outlook of such property-based timing analysis based on the ERC Consolidator project PropRT.

Bio: Jian-Jia Chen is Professor at the Department of Informatics in TU Dortmund University in Germany. He was Junior professor at the Department of Informatics in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany from May 2010 to March 2014. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan in 2006. He received his B.S. degree from the Department of Chemistry at National Taiwan University 2001. Between Jan. 2008 and April 2010, he was a postdoc researcher at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. His research interests include real-time systems, embedded systems, energy-efficient scheduling, power-aware designs, temperature-aware scheduling, and distributed computing. He received the European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Award in 2019. He has received more than 10 Best Paper Awards and Outstanding Paper Awards and has involved in Technical Committees in many international conferences.
